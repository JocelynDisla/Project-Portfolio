Within the 'dodgers-2022.csv', we are provided with a dataset that displays the opponents playing on that day, the date, temperature, weather, time of day, and other characteristics of that day that may impact a visitors experience. With one goal in mind, being, to bring in more visitors to the games so that their is a higher profit from the games, we can dissect this dataset to be able to understand what factors inpact attendace. The following code is the analysis of this dataset in order to find supporting evidence that certain opposing teams bring in more fans than othes.

In this analysis, the data had to be prepared first before any model could be applied. By checking for any null on NA values, the analyst is able to remove unneccessary or even useless values. After checking for missing data, categorical data was transformed into quantitative data for the model. A label encoder from sklearn was used to alter the data, a key was also saved to be able to understand the numerical data created from the categorical data. Once the data was prepared, a training and test set were split and derived from the dataset in order to apply Kmeans to retrieve clusters in the data. The value of K was decided to be 4 using a linear chart using the elbow method to decide the most significant value of k.

Overall, a decision tree classifier was used to predict the opponents in the games by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features, a confusion matrix was then used on this model to help determine the model's performance. The confusion matrix displayed a column of values with a few values in the bottom right corner, this display brought a few questions to mind regarding the model's performance. It was found that opponents with a higher fan base cause the attendance of the game to be much higher than smaller opposing teams with a small fan bases.
