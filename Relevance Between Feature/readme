In this data analysis regarding ALS patients, the data was prepped by removing unneccessary features from the dataset. A standard scaler was then applied to the data to remove the mean and to scale each feature/variable to unit variance. Clusters of data objects in the dataset were then identified with the elbow method to see the amount of clusters best fit the data. A Silhouette visualizer was created instance with KMeans, the silhouette average was then seen with 2 clusters which lead me to choose 2 for my k value. The K means algorith was applied and after Fitting a PCA transformation and plotting the data, it was evident from the scatter plot that the variance was very low. The clusters practically sitting on one another. The data analysis demonstrates with its clusters from the visualization that there is a very low varience among the features and targeted feature; ALSFRS_slope.
