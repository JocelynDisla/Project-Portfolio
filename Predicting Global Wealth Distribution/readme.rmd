Predicting Global Wealth Distribution

The data set for the global income statistics can be found at 'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/global-income-statistics' 
For my data set I will be analying the global income statistics to demonstrate how much income most people that live on earth have from 1958 to 2015. The data set presents multiple variables that are very important such as Category which is the decile leve, basically a 10-dimensional vector of income shares for all of the population deciles in the region which is represented as r and in time represented by t. GINI coefficient is a summary metric of the income distribution, it is the underlying distribution of income within the region in that given time. This dataset can demonstrate the difference among the public income compared to the richer people and also the difference in the global gini values. The category people are placed in should show a significance in the analysis. If most people are falling into a category in which they are making less income on average than others, businesses are able to use this information to figure out who they should be marketing to. Which category of people are more likely to buy their product compared to other groups.
